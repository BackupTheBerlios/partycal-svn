/**
 * PartyCal - a command line based application to discover new events from various sources and repost them to others.
 *
 * the goal is to read data from authorized services like club rss-feed or petzi.ch and write it into stuff like google 
 * calendar, eventful or blogging software. the services supported will have to have an open api for such means.
 *
 * most of the setup can be found in the file config/partycal.ini. you need to register some providers and subscribers 
 * there for this to make any sense. you can override the ini file location by setting the env-variable PARTYCAL_CONFIG
 *
 * partycal is based on php6 and zend framework, hack the lines in lib/PartyCalSetup.php or add the right stuff to php.ini.
 * 
 * Released under the GNU GPL or any other OSI certified license.
